v2.0.0 (2020-05-15)
-------------------

The Zeal package has been rewritten entirely.
It is now more flexible and easier to configure.

**The old `language_mapping` setting has been removed and replaced by `docsets`!**

If you added any custom entries to that setting,
select *Preferences: Zeal Settings* from the Command Palette
and add any entries you added to `docsets_user`,
following the documentation provided in the comments.
